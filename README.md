# Lively
In the future, this will be a modern Notepad for Windows. 

# Intentions
Lively intends on being a plug & play replacement for the default Notepad application on Windows. 
The only additional functionality intended is the ability to edit content font (inc. size, color), and support of toggable live WYSIWYG markdown. 
 
# What's it look like so far? 
It's still quite base, so stay weary.

# Known issues
- The top-right gradient is hardly visible under bright lighting conditions in both the splash-screen & editor. 
- In the editor, paragraph margins restore to default (which appears as 2 enters typically) after CTRL+A.
- In the editor, the first line of the RTB word-wraps prematurely.
