# Lively
In the future, this will be a modern Notepad for Windows. 

# Intentions
Lively intends on being a plug & play replacement for the default Notepad application on Windows. 
The only additional functionality intended is the ability to edit content font (inc. size, color), and support of toggable live WYSIWYG markdown. 
 
# What's it look like so far? 
It's still quite base, so stay weary.

# Platform support
As of now, Lively is only supported on Windows 8+ by default. On other versions, you may be able to manually install .NET Framework 4.8 or compatible versions.
In the future, cross-platform to even mobile may be implemented with the recent release of .NET MPAUI.

# When is release? 
Until Lively is completed, the binaries are private. Early 2021 fits as a good time to expect a release.

# Known issues
- The top-right gradient is hardly visible under bright lighting conditions in both the splash-screen & editor. 
- ~~In the editor, paragraph margins restore to default (which appears as 2 enters typically) after CTRL+A.~~
- In the editor, the first line of the RTB word-wraps prematurely. 

# Other
- If Lively is fully protected by copyright, how come it's open source?
   - Two reasons:
     - I intend on building some portfolio. 
     - GitHub serves as a platform to easily report issues & make suggestions.
